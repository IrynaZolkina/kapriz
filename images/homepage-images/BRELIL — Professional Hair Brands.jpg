This may involve placing funds in the account linked to your Nominated Payment Source on hold each time you make an online purchase, obtain a barcode for an in-store purchase or add a new Card to your Afterpay Account. For online purchases, we immediately instruct your bank to void this pre-authorisation transaction. For in-store, where a barcode is obtained but a purchase does not eventuate, we instruct the bank to void the pre-authorisation if the barcode is cancelled or expires. No funds are received by Afterpay during this process. We cannot guarantee the time it takes for your bank to process this action by us and make your funds available.</p><p>PLEASE NOTE: In most circumstances, relevant banks will void a pre-authorisation transaction within a few hours of the pre-authorisation transaction being conducted by Afterpay. However, in some observed instances, banks have taken up to fourteen (14) days to finalise this process. Unfortunately, we do not have any control or influence over the timing of your bank\u2019s ability to finalise this process and Afterpay makes no representations on this subject matter.</p><p>Please read this Agreement carefully. By clicking to accept these terms and using Afterpay\u2019s Products, you agree to be bound by (i) this Agreement; and (ii) Afterpay\u2019s Privacy Policy which can be found <a href=\"https://www.afterpay.com/en-AU/privacy-policy\" title=\"https://www.afterpay.com/en-AU/privacy-policy\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>here</strong></a>. The headings contained in this document are for reference purposes only. You should print a copy of this Agreement and Afterpay\u2019s Privacy Policy for your records.</p><p><br><strong>1. Welcome to our Website</strong></p><p>We set out below the terms and conditions of your use of, and access to, our Products. Please read these terms and conditions carefully, as they impose rules, obligations and other responsibilities on you in respect of your use of the Products.</p><p></p><p>1.1 Parties to this Agreement</p><p>This Agreement is a contract between you (\u2018you\u2019 or \u2018your\u2019) and Afterpay Pty Ltd ACN 169 342 947 (\u2018Afterpay\u2019, \u2018we\u2019, \u2018us\u2019, \u2018our\u2019). It sets out the terms and conditions that apply to your use of our Products. You agree that your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and ongoing use of our Products, shall constitute your acceptance of this Agreement.</p><p>If you do not want to be bound by this Agreement, you must not make a purchase using Afterpay Products.</p><p></p><p>1.2 Policies incorporated into this Agreement</p><p>Before you create an account with us or use any of our Products, you should read this Agreement, as well as Afterpay\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.afterpay.com/en-AU/privacy-policy\" title=\"Afterpay Privacy Policy\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></a> and any other policy found on the Website, which are incorporated into this Agreement by reference.<br><br>We recommend that you store or print a copy of this Agreement (including all policies) for your records.To the extent of any inconsistency between this Agreement and any incorporated policy, the incorporated policy will prevail.</p><p></p><p>1.3 Changes to this Agreement</p><p>(a) Afterpay may amend this Agreement at any time for any reason including, for example, if we change the functionality of our Products, introduce new products, or as required by law. We will post the amended Agreement on our Website. Each time you place an Order you will be asked to agree to the then current terms of this Agreement. Please read this Agreement carefully each time you agree to its terms when placing an Order. If you do not agree with the changes, you may close your Afterpay Account in accordance with clause 3.4.</p><p>(b) We will not change any terms and conditions for an existing Order that has been accepted by us; the terms and conditions that will apply to an accepted Order (and any steps taken in relation to such Order, e.g., cancellation, refunds, etc.) are the terms and conditions that applied at the time you made the Order.</p><p></p><p><strong>4. Orders, payments and billing</strong></p><p></p><p>4.1 Order Confirmation and Payment Schedule</p><p>(a) All Orders which you place with Afterpay are subject to approval by Afterpay, in our reasonable discretion. We may choose not to approve an Order or provide a Product to you, or may cancel an approved Order before the goods or services are delivered or supplied, if:</p><p>(i) we reasonably consider this necessary in order to:<br>(A) protect the integrity of our systems or the Products;<br>(B) prevent fraud;<br>(C) limit the risk of money laundering or terrorism financing; or<br>(D) otherwise protect us against legal, regulatory or non-payment risk;</p><p>(ii) you do not pass our verifications or checks, including those described in clause 6;</p><p>(iii) we reasonably suspect, or are aware, that you have breached this Agreement in a material respect (including by failing to make any payment due under this Agreement on the payment due date);</p><p>(iv) an Order is made with a merchant in a different jurisdiction that is not permitted by Afterpay; or</p><p>(v) we otherwise reasonably consider the Order to be suspicious.</p><p>(b) If we cancel an approved Order:(i) we will apply a full refund of any amounts you have paid to us to your Nominated Payment Source or (if that is not possible) to any other Card that you have provided us details of, and will cancel any future payments related to that Order. In the event the approved Order is cancelled because a chargeback has been incurred by Afterpay in relation to a payment for the approved Order, that payment will not be refunded by Afterpay. Any return of funds in that event will be as between you and your issuing bank. The Retailer will not be obliged to deliver the goods (or provide the services) the subject of the Order, unless required to do so by law;<br>(ii) you will have no obligation to make any further payments to us, or any other ongoing relationship with us, with respect to that Order; and<br>(iii) if you wish to proceed with the purchase from the Retailer, the Retailer may accept an alternative payment method in its discretion, or if required to do so by law.</p><p>(c) Once we approve your Order, you will receive an email from us with confirmation of receipt of your Order and a Payment Schedule.</p><p>(d) You agree to ensure that payment(s) are made in accordance with the Payment Schedule. You may make early payments through your Afterpay Account, otherwise Afterpay will automatically process payments in accordance with the due dates stated on the Payment Schedule. You authorise Afterpay to process such payments using the Payment Method details provided by you. If an Automatic Payment fails on any of the dates specified in your Payment Schedule, Afterpay reserves the right to re-attempt to process the payment at a later time or date.</p><p><br>4.2 Automatic Payments</p><p>(a) An \u2018Automatic Payment\u2019 is a payment, through the Payment Method you have chosen, that we will automatically charge directly to your nominated Card (\u2018Nominated Payment Source\u2019) on a one-time or regular basis in agreed upon amounts as outlined in your Payment Schedule. You will have the option to select a preferred Payment Method and Nominated Payment Source when your Afterpay Account is being created. You can update or change your preferred Nominated Payment Source or Payment Method at any time via your Afterpay Account.</p><p>(b) Subject to the other terms of this Agreement, You hereby expressly consent to, authorise and instruct Afterpay to deduct Automatic Payment amounts from your Nominated Payment Source for the amounts and on those scheduled dates set out in your Payment Schedule. You acknowledge that you are giving us the ability to collect or reverse variable payment amounts from or to your Nominated Payment Source, in accordance with your Payment Schedule and the terms of this Agreement.</p><p><br>(c) You are responsible for ensuring that you have sufficient funds in your Nominated Payment Source available to make Automatic Payments on the dates specified in your Payment Schedule. You are liable for any fees or charges imposed by your Nominated Payment Source, except to the extent that such fees or charges arise as a result of our error or system failure. If any fees or charges are imposed as a result of our error or system failure, please provide us with a copy of the relevant records, and we will reimburse you for the relevant fees or charges.</p><p><br>(d) If an Automatic Payment fails (for example, if your Nominated Payment Source is a credit or debit card which has expired), Late Fees may apply unless you otherwise make the scheduled payment on or before the relevant due date. You authorise us to satisfy any monetary liability you owe us by:(i) Debiting your Nominated Payment Source at a later time or date;<br>(ii) Debiting any other Card which you have provided details of;<br>(iii) Offsetting the payment amount against any amounts we may owe to you; or<br>(iv) Any other legal means.</p><p>Please see clause 4.3 below for more information regarding Late Fees.</p><p><br>4.3 Late Payments</p><p>(a) If you fail to pay any amounts according to the Payment Schedule, Late Fees will apply on each payment that is due but not received. For the avoidance of doubt, Late Fees will not be applied until the day immediately following the day that the payment is due.</p><p><br>(b) We may, at our sole discretion, reasonably delay the application of, or waive wholly or partly, any Late Fee. If Late Fees are or may be incurred as a result of Afterpay\u2019s error, please let us know, and we will waive or refund such fees, as relevant.</p><p><br>4.4 Fees</p><p>(a) Charges or Fees, if any, payable by you for the use of our Products or your Afterpay Account will be set out in Schedule 1 to this Agreement.</p><p></p><p>4.5 Cross Border Transactions</p><p>Where you use our Products to make a Cross Border Transaction, we will convert what the Retailer charges for the goods into your local currency using a retail exchange rate selected by Afterpay at our discretion to determine the Original Order Value and the amounts payable by you in accordance with your Payment Schedule. The exchange rate used will change regularly to reflect the currency fluctuations in the foreign exchange market.</p><p>No set up fees or foreign exchange commission will be applied to the exchange rate applied to perform the conversion.</p><p><br>4.6 Interest</p><p>(a) No interest charges are payable by you for the use of our Products.</p><p><br>4.7 No set off</p><p>Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, you must make all payments in accordance with the Payment Schedule and pay all other amounts in full to us under this Agreement without any set-off, withholding or reduction for any reason whatsoever, including any existing or future act, omission or default by us.</p><p><br><strong>5. Refunds</strong></p><p>(a) If you decide to return goods to a Retailer, which have been purchased using our Products, and request a refund, or a return and refund are otherwise accepted by the Retailer or permitted by law, you will directly arrange the return with the Retailer, ensuring that the goods are returned according to the Retailer\u2019s returns policy or other instructions or your rights at law.</p><p><br>(b) It is your responsibility to notify the Retailer if you intend to return any goods. The return must be completed within the period specified and in the manner required by the Retailer\u2019s returns policy or as otherwise permitted by the retailer.</p><p><br>(c) Unless we are notified by a Retailer that a return and refund is in progress, we will continue to process any Automatic Payments in accordance with the dates set out in your Payment Schedule.</p><p><br>(d) Until such time that the Retailer has confirmed the return of the goods and has issued a refund to us for those goods, you will remain liable to us for the full payment of the goods, in accordance with your Payment Schedule.</p><p><br>(e) Once the Retailer has issued a refund to us for the goods, we will issue a refund to your Nominated Payment Source (or, if that is not possible, to any other Card that you have provided details of) and/or adjust your Payment Schedule appropriately (including to reduce or cancel any future payments, if necessary). Please note, in the event of partial refunds, refund amounts are taken off the last payment/s first. If the refund is processed to your expired or cancelled card, you will need to obtain the returned funds by contacting your financial institution.</p><p>For example, if you make a $400 purchase using Afterpay and the retailer approves a $250 refund, we will cancel your 3rd and 4th instalments of $100, and amend your 2nd instalment to $50. Your new payment schedule will become 2 payments (instead of 4) of $100 &amp; $50. If you had already paid 2 instalments of $100 each, a refund of $50 would be applied to your card and the remaining 2 instalments would be cancelled.</p><p>When a Retailer issues a refund for a Cross Border Transaction, Afterpay will use the original retail exchange rate (used at the time the order was placed) to determine the refund amount to apply to your Nominated Payment Source for the relevant goods.</p><p>For example, if a New Zealand Retailer charged 100NZD which was converted to $96 as the Original Order Value, if the Retailer issues a refund for 50NZD, your order total and Payment Schedule will be adjusted by $48.</p><p>(f) Where you wish to return a product 120 days or more after the purchase date, we will no longer have any involvement in the product return process (i.e. the Retailer will provide any agreed refund directly to you).</p><p></p><p><strong>6.
